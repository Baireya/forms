    Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext
    browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose.

    Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in A File Structure for the Complex, the
    Changing, and the Indeterminate. 20th National Conference, New York,
    Association for Computing Machinery, 1965. See also: Literary Machines.
    Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected
    Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting the resource did not
    maintain the link. Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing
    System and FRESS in 1967. 1980 While consulting for CERN June-December of
    1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program,
    "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to be made between
    arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional
    typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III. See:
